# site component
The site component contains events and user interactions present on every page.

## On page load
* Animate the search input's placeholder text as if it's being typed by a person.
* Add the height of the `<header>` as top margin to the next element in the DOM.
* When the user is not scrolled to the top of the page, shrink the header and fix it at the top of the document.
* When the search input in the header is focused, add a `focused` class to its container. 
* When the main menu's search input is focused, add a `focused` class to its container. 
* Toggle the main menu's display when the user clicks or tabs over the trigger element.
* Toggle the language menu's display when the user clicks or tabs over the trigger element.
