<p>Contact tracing is an important step in slowing the spread of COVID-19. It&#8217;s when health workers notify you that you&#8217;ve been in contact with an infected person, and you should also get tested. Public health departments have used contact tracing for decades to fight infectious disease.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Introducing <strong>California Connected</strong>, our state’s contact tracing program.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image text-center"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized">
    <img width="302" src="https://files.covid19.ca.gov/img/CAConnected_Logo_Tag_4C--en.png" alt="Connected California">
  </figure></div>



<p>Under this program, health workers will talk to those who have tested positive. They&#8217;ll alert anyone they may have exposed, keeping names confidential. They&#8217;ll check symptoms, offer testing, and discuss next steps like <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/quarantine.html">quarantine</a>, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/isolation.html">self-isolation</a> and medical care.</p>



<p>By finding spread patterns quickly, we slow infection and help avoid outbreaks. This lets California keep healthcare needs below capacity and safely reopen business.</p>



<h2>All you have to do is answer a phone call</h2>



<p>Contact tracing is an anonymous way to do your part. The more people answer the call, the more lives and jobs California saves. Your information is always kept confidential.</p>



<p>Early awareness helps you protect your friends and loved ones from exposure. And early medical care can improve your outcome.</p>



<p>The sooner we can reach you, the sooner you can get advice, testing, and support.</p>



<h2>How does contact tracing work?</h2>

Contact tracing is a simple, confidential process that has been used by public health departments for decades to slow the spread of infectious disease and avoid outbreaks. The more people who answer the call, the more lives and jobs California saves.
How does contact tracing work? If you test positive for COVID-19: Separate yourself from those in your home and avoid contact with others to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Your local health department will contact you.
They will connect you to medical care and help you find resources and support if needed. They may stay in touch with you to see if you're okay.
They will ask about places you have been and the people you have spent time with recently. Your information is confidential and will not be shared, and you will not be asked about your immigration status.
Those people will be told they may have been exposed, but they will NOT be told your name or any personal information.
If you have been in contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19:
You will receive a call from a public health worker who will help you understand the next steps.
They will provide access at no cost to you and medical care, if needed. You will also be asked to separate yourself from others in your home to protect those around you. They will stay in touch to see if you develop symptoms or need access to help.

<h4 class="wp-accordion">How do I become a contact tracer?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The initial phase of California Connected, the state’s contact tracing program, will utilize existing resources and redirect state employees to begin contact tracing efforts. Offers of additional support from the private sector and qualified members of the public are appreciated, but contact tracers from outside state government may not be needed until a future phase. Thank you for wanting to share your expertise and resources with your fellow Californians.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion" id="Extra-sick-leave">Is there extra sick leave available for workers who have COVID-19 symptoms or are waiting for test results?</h4>

<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li><strong>Federal paid sick leave: </strong>Up to 80 hours under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (<a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/pandemic/ffcra-employee-paid-leave">FFCRA</a>) for businesses with less than 500 workers.&nbsp;See <a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/pandemic/ffcra-questions">more information on FFCRA in its FAQs</a>.</li><li><strong>California COVID-19 supplemental paid sick leave:</strong>&nbsp;Food businesses with more than 500 workers must give up to 80 hours of <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/4.16.20-EO-N-51-20.pdf">paid sick leave</a>.&nbsp; See <a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/FAQ-for-PSL.html">more information on supplemental paid sick leave</a>.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Local paid sick leave ordinances:</strong> Certain local areas also have paid sick leave ordinances.&nbsp; Consult with the local enforcement agency in your area.</li></ul>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">What steps are required when a business has an employee who tests positive?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If an employer discovers a worker has tested positive for COVID-19 or has symptoms, they should send the worker home.

Employers should support the need for workers to stay home for the protection of others with flexible leave policies.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The employer must provide the following details to the local health department on the confirmed COVID-19 workers:&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>job titles,&nbsp;</li><li>work areas,&nbsp;</li><li><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/contact-tracing/contact-tracing-plan/appendix.html#contact">close contact</a> in the workplace,&nbsp;</li><li>dates of symptom onset, and&nbsp;</li><li>shifts worked while infectious.</li></ul>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can people who recover from COVID-19 be re-infected?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">We don’t yet know. The duration of immunity to coronavirus infection is not yet understood. Patients infected with other similar coronaviruses are unlikely to be re-infected in the months after they recover. However, more information is needed to know whether similar immune protection will be observed for patients with COVID-19.</p>
