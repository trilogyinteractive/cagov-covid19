<h2>Questions and answers on financial relief</h2>



<h4 class="wp-accordion"><strong>What effect will this have on my credit report?</strong></h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Financial institutions will not report derogatory information (like late payments) to credit reporting agencies but may report a forbearance. Typically this does not negatively affect a credit score on its own.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion"><strong>How long will these programs last?</strong></h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">It is still unclear how severe or how long the COVID-19 impact will be. Financial institutions have committed to necessary relief and will be assessing the ongoing conditions and need for continuing relief.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion"><strong>What if my financial institution isn’t offering this relief?</strong></h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Call or check their website to be sure. At this time, JP Morgan Chase, US Bank, Wells Fargo and Citigroup, <a href="https://dbo.ca.gov/covid19-updates-fi/">and nearly 200 state-chartered banks</a>, credit unions are supporting these commitments.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion"><strong>What if I already made a payment or was hit with a fee because of COVID-19?</strong></h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Talk to your financial institution. These measures go into effect as of March 25, 2020.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion"><strong>Is mortgage relief available to businesses?</strong></h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The relief is currently only available for residential mortgages.</p>
