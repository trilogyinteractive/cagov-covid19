<p>Health care — including coronavirus testing for people who need it — should be affordable for all Californians.<br> </p>



<p>If you are experiencing <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/symptoms-and-risks/#top">symptoms</a> of COVID-19 or you think you were exposed to someone with COVID-19, then under federal law, you do not need to pay a co-pay to be tested. In all other circumstances, you may be required to pay a co-pay, just like you would when getting any other health care service.</p>



<div style="display:none;" class="js-qa js-qa-question">Can I get free COVID-19 testing or treatment if I am a senior over 65, disabled, uninsured, or an undocumented immigrant?</div>



<p class="js-qa js-qa-answer"><a href="https://www.medicare.gov/medicare-coronavirus">Medicare</a> and <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/sign-up-change-plans/types-of-medicare-health-plans/medicare-advantage-plans">Medicare Advantage Plans</a> cover <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/coverage/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-tests">coronavirus tests</a> and <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/coverage/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-antibody-test">antibody </a>tests, with no out-of-pocket costs. The cost of medically necessary coronavirus screening, testing, and treatment for the uninsured is paid for by the <a href="https://www.hrsa.gov/CovidUninsuredClaim">government</a>. </p>

<h2 id="questions">Questions and answers</h2>



<h3>Face coverings and masks</h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Should I wear a face covering or mask to protect against COVID-19?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. Californians must wear face coverings when in public spaces, especially indoors and other areas where physical distancing is not possible. Face coverings help reduce the spread of COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) has released a <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/Guidance-for-Face-Coverings_06-18-2020.pdf">Guidance</a> for the use of face covering.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The guidance reminds Californians that the best defense against COVID-19 continues to be:&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Maintain&nbsp;six feet of physical distance from others&nbsp;</li><li>Wash hands frequently</li><li>Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands</li><li>Avoid being around people with COVID-19 symptoms</li></ul>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How well do face coverings prevent spread of COVID-19?&nbsp;</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">There is scientific evidence to suggest that use of face coverings by the public during a pandemic could help reduce disease transmission. Their primary role is to reduce the release of infectious particles into the air when someone speaks, coughs, or sneezes, including someone who has COVID-19 but feels well. Face coverings are not a substitute for physical distancing, washing hands, and staying home when ill, but they may be helpful when combined with these primary interventions.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">What is a face covering?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">A face covering is <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html">material that covers the nose and mouth</a>. It can be secured to the head with ties or straps or simply wrapped around the lower face. It can be made of a variety of materials, such as cotton, silk, or linen. A face covering may be factory-made or sewn by hand, or can be improvised from household items such as scarfs, T-shirts, sweatshirts, or towels.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How should I care for a face covering?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">It’s a good idea to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html">wash your face covering</a> frequently, ideally after each use. Have a bag or bin to keep face coverings in until they can be laundered with detergent and hot water and dried on a hot cycle. If you must re-wear your face covering before washing, wash your hands immediately after putting it back on and avoid touching your face. Discard coverings that:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>No longer cover the nose and mouth</li><li>Have stretched out or damaged ties or straps</li><li>Cannot stay on the face</li><li>Have holes or tears in the fabric</li></ul>



<h3>Insurance and cost</h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">What if I don’t have health insurance and I need screening,&nbsp;testing, or treatment for COVID-19?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The cost of medically necessary screening, testing, and treatment for the uninsured is paid for by the <a href="https://www.hrsa.gov/CovidUninsuredClaim">government</a>. You can check your symptoms using the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fsymptoms-testing%2Findex.html">Symptom Screener</a> or by contacting your doctor through <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/telehealth/">telehealth</a>. You can also get free medically necessary <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/testing-and-treatment/">testing</a> through <a href="https://www.projectbaseline.com/study/covid-19/eligibility/">Verily&#8217;s Project Baseline</a> or <a href="https://lhi.care/covidtesting">OptumServe</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Does my health plan have to cover my COVID-19 test?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes, if you’re experiencing COVID-19 symptoms, you think you were exposed to someone who has COVID-19, or the test is otherwise medically necessary for your situation.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If you have symptoms of COVID-19 or you think you’ve been exposed to someone with COVID-19, under federal law, you can obtain a COVID-19 test anywhere and your health plan must pay for the test.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If you don’t have symptoms and don’t think you’ve been exposed to someone with COVID-19, but you are an <a href="https://www.dmhc.ca.gov/Portals/0/Docs/DO/DMHC-FAQForHealthCoverageOfCOVID-19Testing.pdf">essential worker</a> as defined for COVID-19 testing coverage, your health plan must cover your COVID-19 test. However, you must contact your health plan before getting testing.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If you don’t have symptoms, don’t think you’ve been exposed to someone with COVID-19, and aren’t an <a href="https://www.dmhc.ca.gov/Portals/0/Docs/DO/DMHC-FAQForHealthCoverageOfCOVID-19Testing.pdf">essential worker</a> as defined for COVID-19 testing coverage, and you think you need a test, please contact your health plan or health care provider for further guidance.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">As a first step, you can check your symptoms using the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fsymptoms-testing%2Findex.html">Symptom Screener</a> or by contacting your doctor through <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/telehealth/">telehealth</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How long will I have to wait to get a test?&nbsp;</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Your wait time<strong> </strong>depends on why you are seeking a test.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content"><strong>If you have symptoms of COVID-19 or think you were exposed,</strong> under federal law, you can go immediately to any available testing site. Find a testing site on our <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/testing-and-treatment/#top">Testing page,</a> or call your health plan so they can direct you to an available testing location.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content"><strong>If you don’t have symptoms or suspected exposure, and you are an </strong><a href="https://www.dmhc.ca.gov/Portals/0/Docs/DO/DMHC-FAQForHealthCoverageOfCOVID-19Testing.pdf"><strong>essential worker</strong></a><strong>,</strong> your health plan must offer you a test appointment within 48 hours. The testing site must be within 15 miles or 30 minutes of your residence or workplace. If the health plan can’t find you an available appointment within that time and distance, then you can go to any available testing site and your health plan will pay for the test.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content"><strong>If you don’t have symptoms or suspected exposure, and you are not an essential worker,</strong> if your provider determines a COVID-19 test is medically necessary for you, your health plan must offer you a test appointment within 96 hours. The testing site must be within 15 miles or 30 minutes of your residence or workplace. If the health plan can’t find you an available appointment within that time and distance, you can go to any available testing site.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">I get my health care coverage through my employer, who has a “self-insured” plan. Do the California Department of Managed Health Care (DMHC) regulations apply to me?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Self-insured plans are regulated by the federal government, rather than the state. If you have symptoms of COVID-19 or you were exposed to someone who you know or suspect has COVID-19, under federal law, your employer’s self-insured plan must cover your test. In all other instances, you should talk to your employer’s self-insured plan to find out whether they will cover COVID-19 testing.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How does my health plan know if I’m an essential worker?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Your health plan can ask you questions about why you want a COVID-19 test and about the nature of your work. They can ask these questions to help determine whether a COVID-19 test is medically necessary for you.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">However, your health plan can’t ask you to provide further documentation or evidence of your work status. For example, your health plan can’t ask you to provide written proof of where you work or the conditions of your workplace.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">I have a concern or complaint about getting care for COVID-19 under my health insurance. What can I do?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If you are having trouble accessing care, or were inappropriately charged for medically necessary screening, testing, or treatment for COVID-19, follow up directly with your health plan by calling the member phone number listed on your health plan card. If your health plan doesn’t resolve the issue, contact the <a href="http://www.dmhc.ca.gov/?referral=healthhelp.ca.gov">California Department of Managed Health Care (DMHC)</a> Help Center for assistance at 1-888-466-2219.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Do Medicare or Medicare Advantage Plans cover coronavirus tests or coronavirus antibody tests?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. Both <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/medicare-coronavirus">Medicare</a> and <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/sign-up-change-plans/types-of-medicare-health-plans/medicare-advantage-plans">Medicare Advantage Plans</a> cover <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/coverage/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-tests">coronavirus tests</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/coverage/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-antibody-test">antibody </a>tests, with no out-of-pocket costs.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can I use telehealth if I am on Medicare?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. Medicare has temporarily expanded its coverage of <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/coverage/telehealth">telehealth services (medical care via phone, video chat, or online portal)</a> to respond to the current Public Health Emergency. You can now use a wide range of communication tools (including smartphone) from home to interact with a range of providers, like doctors, nurse practitioners, clinical psychologists, licensed clinical social workers, physical therapists, occupational therapists, and speech language pathologists. If you have original Medicare, you can get many services without a copayment through <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/telehealth/">telehealth,</a> including evaluation and management visits (common office visits), mental health counseling, and preventive health screenings.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If you have a <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/sign-up-change-plans/types-of-medicare-health-plans/medicare-advantage-plans">Medicare Advantage Plan</a>, you have access to these same benefits. Many plans offer additional <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/telehealth/">telehealth</a> benefits and expanded benefits, like meal delivery or medical transport services. Check with your plan about your coverage and costs.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">What COVID-19 testing and treatments are covered by the federal government&#8217;s free uninsured program?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The following services are covered by the federal government if you are&nbsp; uninsured and diagnosed with a primary COVID-19 diagnosis:</p>
